# Swappy - Plugin Updater

**Swappy** is a lightweight companion plugin that automatically updates the plugins you choose based on a simple `.yml` configuration. It checks for updates from public (or private) GitHub repositories and downloads the latest releases when the server starts.

## üèì Installation
- Download the version of the plugin that matches your framework (**LabApi** or **Exiled**).
- Place the `.dll` file in your server's `plugins` folder.
- Restart your server to apply the changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must include **one .dll per framework** in the plugins folder! The **LabApi version** will only update **LabApi plugins**, and the **Exiled version** will only update **Exiled plugins**. If you place a plugin from a different framework in the plugins folder, the plugin will be downloaded into the wrong folder and simply **won‚Äôt be loaded**..
